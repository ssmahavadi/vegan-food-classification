# Vegan Food Classification

This project was completed in May of 2021. The task at hand is to classify vegan foods as one of three mutually exclusive categories—fruit, vegetable, or 'other'—by means of decision trees. To accomplish this task, I created my own dataset containing 28 foods (10 fruit, 10 vegetable, and 8 'other')

For a detailed explanation of all of my decisions within the process of creating the decision trees, you can read my paper (https://bit.ly/etree-ia).
